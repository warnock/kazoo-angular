### Plan:

## What I need/functionality:
* an animal class with species, name, age, diet, zoo location, number of needed caretakers, sex, one like and one dislike properties
* the ability to add new instances of the animal class
* the ability to list all logged animals
* a select menu to view all animals, young animals (two years or less), and old animals (two years or older)
* an update button to edit an animals name, age, and caretakers


## wants:
* image property of the animal
* totally badass design


## Components/files I will need:
* app.component.ts <- root Component
* edit-animal.compnent.ts <- edit name, age, caretaker properties
* new-animal.component.ts <- add new animal
* animal-list.component.ts <- list of animals
* a animal.pipe.ts file
* a animal.model.ts file to hold animal class


## Functionality to implement in the future
* a place for caretaker information such as name
* a place to log ongoing notes about the animal and it's health
* directions on each animals individual care for getting new caretakers up to speed
* a featured animal of the week to celebrate well trained/behaved animals
* sort by animal types, location withing the park, or animals assigned to particular caretakers
